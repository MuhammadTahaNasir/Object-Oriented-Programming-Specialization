# Object-Oriented Programming in C++ Specialization

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) specialization in C++ from Goldsmiths, University of London, via Coursera. This repository showcases projects completed as part of the specialization, focusing on practical applications of C++ and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Courses Completed
- **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in C++**
- **C++ Programming: Classes and Data**
- **Object-Oriented Programming in C++: Functions**
- **Working with Objects in C++**
- **Use C++ to Build a Crypto Trading Platform: Final System**

## Final Project
During this specialization, I developed a simplified cryptocurrency trading platform as the final project. This project demonstrates proficiency in various programming techniques, including:
- Basic control flow and input/output
- File parsing
- User interaction on the console

## Repository Contents
- Detailed implementations and documentation of the final project.

## Acknowledgments
A special thanks to Dr. Matthew Yee-King, Goldsmiths, University of London, and Coursera for providing an enriching learning experience in C++ and OOP.
